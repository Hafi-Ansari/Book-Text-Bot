Parser: This a program to parse through a given epub and add it to MongoDB where every paragraph is a document. You will have to specify the file-path of the document in conversions.py and which encoding style you want to parse through (currently set to windows-1252). A requirements.txt file is provided to list all the necessary Python imports for your virtual environment to make conversions.py work. The environment variable not pushed to github is the MONGO_URL to specify the Mongo Cluster the book data will be sent to. To use Parser, activate your virtual environment and run conversion.py with "python conversion.py". 

Bot: To Be Added
