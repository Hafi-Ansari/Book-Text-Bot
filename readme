This repository is a project to make a Discord Bot that acts as a Text-Bot so users can query for different quotes in a given book. 

Tech-Stack: Discord.js, Node.js, Python, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Elastic Cloud

Libraries:

Python:
  beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
  dnspython==2.3.0
  EbookLib==0.18
  lxml==4.9.2
  pymongo==4.4.0
  python-dateutil==2.8.2
  python-dotenv==1.0.0
  six==1.16.0
  soupsieve==2.4.1

Node.js: 
  "@elastic/elasticsearch": "^7.17.11-patch.1",
  "discord.js": "^14.11.0",
  "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
  "mongodb": "^5.6.0"

Parser: This a program to parse through a given epub and add it to MongoDB where every paragraph is a document. You will have to specify the file-path of the document in conversions.py and which encoding style you want to parse through (currently set to windows-1252). A requirements.txt file is provided to list all the necessary Python imports for your virtual environment to make conversions.py work. The environment variable not pushed to github is the MONGO_URL to specify the Mongo Cluster the book data will be sent to. To use Parser, activate your virtual environment and run conversion.py with "python conversion.py". 

Bot: Connect with Elastic Cloud using database.js and perform queries to data indexed to ElasticSearch. Requires the npm @elastic/elasticsearch library as well as Elastic auth. Performs full-text search as well as fuzzy search.
